title: Dashiel Mercer Character Bible v1.7 \[Integrated\]
---

# Core Identity

Astra's golden boy. Wunderkind pilot of the Valiant Gundam.

Represents the prototypical Gundam hero mold --- calm, disciplined,
textbook ace.

Not perfect, but prototypical --- the archetype that others try to
emulate.

# Public Face vs. Private Truth

Public: the destined savior. Civilians rally to him, soldiers admire
him, Astra brass call him their \'hope.\'

Private: kind, dutiful, but not revolutionary. He follows the mold
exactly as intended. Believes fulfilling that role is enough.

# Beliefs & Contradictions

Believes discipline and training are sufficient --- the hero's burden is
his to carry.

Contradiction: while he inspires faith, he lacks the adaptability to
survive Tomas. He embodies the ideal form of a pilot, but Tomas shows
ideals are brittle.

# Pilot Style (Valiant Gundam)

Textbook Gundam hero style: balanced offense and defense, measured, no
wasted energy.

Commands presence on the battlefield --- the kind of pilot civilians and
soldiers alike can point to and say: \'That's a Gundam.\'

# Key Turning Points

Act II, Ep. 6: Introduced. Fred relieved: \'Finally, someone meant to be
here.\'

Ep. 8: Nerina's sortie convinces Astra brass that Horizon should go to
Dashiel.

Ep. 9--10: Flies alongside Fred. Becomes the \'false lead\' --- Fred
looks like he's improving by osmosis, civilians whisper the Reaper is
learning from the Hero.

Ep. 11/12: Before transfer to Horizon, sorties one last time in Valiant.
Regalia erases him instantly.

Nerina's Fracture: Feels nothing from him in his final moment. Creed
cracks.

Fred's Collapse: Fragile hope of improving dies with Dashiel.

# Myth vs. Reality

Myth: Dashiel = \'the hero who will save us.\' Astra believes this so
fully they try to reassign Horizon to him.

Reality: He is erased instantly, not even knowing he was attacked.

His death = proof that the hero mold is meaningless against Tomas.

# Visual POV Language

Framed as the \'clean Gundam hero\' --- symmetrical shots, bright
balanced color.

In Fred's grayscale POV, Dashiel seems untouched by the shadows that
plague Fred. When he dies, that \'clean frame\' collapses suddenly.

# Arc Summary

Act II: Introduced, admired, poised to be Horizon's pilot. Fred becomes
his wingman; audience sees a fakeout trajectory.

Mid-Act II: Erased by Tomas before the transfer can happen.

Purpose: Serves as Astra's course correction --- the \'real hero\' they
think they need --- and proves Tomas right: the mold cannot stand
against inevitability.

His death fractures Nerina, shatters Fred's hope, and cements Tomas's
obsession with Fred as the anomaly.
