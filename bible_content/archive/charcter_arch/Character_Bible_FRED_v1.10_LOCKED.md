title: Fred Character Bible v1.7 \[Integrated\]
---

# Core Identity

Ordinary man, not soldier. Lost wife and child; grief is his permanent
shadow.

Wears a mask of humor and clumsiness, convincing himself it's for others
--- in truth, it's for himself.

He survives where others die because he cannot stop moving forward, even
when terrified.

# Public Face vs. Private Truth

Public: bumbling, reluctant pilot, almost comedic to those around him.
Civilians mythologize his chaotic survival as the Black Reaper.

Private: horrified, exhausted, carrying grief so heavy he sometimes
wishes to stop --- but never does, because he cares.

# Beliefs & Contradictions

Believes he pilots Horizon only because he \'has to.\' Terrified of it,
calls it cursed.

Secretly, he clings to it --- because surviving inside Horizon gives him
purpose.

Contradiction: He believes his mask is for others, but really it's for
himself.

# Pilot Style

Beginning: true bumbler. Panicked flailing mistaken as improvisation.

Middle: basic competence; he can point Horizon where it needs to go, but
never elegantly.

End: never becomes an ace --- his movements remain awkward,
unpredictable. Precisely this inefficiency makes him impossible to
pre-solve.

# Visual POV Language

Grayscale Vision: Fred sees the world drained of color --- grief painted
over everything.

Act IV: when Horizon Aether is born, color returns. His survival is no
longer \'painted black,\' but chosen with compassion.

# Arc Summary

Act I: Accidentally survives. Mask misread as brilliance.

Act II: Feels hope flying alongside Dashiel, but it dies with him.

Act III: Watches Nerina die, Horizon destroyed, Tomas reveal his
identity. Broken, but survives.

Act IV: Realizes his mask was always for himself. Crystallizes his
truth: \'I move because I care. Always.\'

ablative, self-repairing with butterfly-knife reformation.
