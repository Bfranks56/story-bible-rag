title: Potential Ideas v1.7 \[Integrated\]
---

# Season 1 Stinger (Locked)

After Regalia destroys Horizon and Tomas departs, Fred survives ---
later fuses Horizon + Aetheris into Horizon Aether.

Final POV: Fred regains color vision. He turns away, momentarily at
peace.

Camera widens --- part of world silently fades back to grayscale.
Ambiguous: grief may never fully vanish.

# Season 2 Core Theme (Elevated Idea)

Anchor Song: \'New Year's Day\' (U2).

Season 1 (Paint It Black) = grief, compassion, void.

Season 2 (New Year's Day) = endurance, renewal, scars carried forward.

Themes: survivors grappling with post-war world; hope as renewal vs
repetition.

# Kale (OVA / Future Villain Seed)

Child refugee aboard Astra in S1. Innocent, overlooked.

Grows up myth-struck by Angel + Reaper. Later disillusioned when reality
doesn't match.

Returns as antagonist in OVA/Season --- villain born not from void (like
Tomas) but from broken faith in compassion + survival.

# Other Notes & Concepts

Concordia's Idyllic Facade: beautiful harmony outside, dystopia beneath
--- disappearances, remediation.

Fred's Mask Motif: branding/marketing echo --- jovial mask cracking
underneath.

OVA Potential: explore Concordia's silenced officers (Bancroft, Quen).
