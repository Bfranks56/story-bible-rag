title: Potential Ideas v1.7 \[Integrated\]
---

# Season 1 Stinger (Locked)

After Regalia destroys Horizon and Tomas departs, Fred survives ---
later fuses Horizon + Aetheris into Horizon Aether.

Final POV: Fred regains color vision. He turns away, momentarily at
peace.

Camera widens --- part of world silently fades back to grayscale.
Ambiguous: grief may never fully vanish.

# Season 2 Core Theme (Elevated Idea)

Anchor Song: \'New Year's Day\' (U2).

Season 1 (Paint It Black) = grief, compassion, void.

Season 2 (New Year's Day) = endurance, renewal, scars carried forward.

Themes: survivors grappling with post-war world; hope as renewal vs
repetition.

# Kale (OVA / Future Villain Seed)

Child refugee aboard Astra in S1. Innocent, overlooked.

Grows up myth-struck by Angel + Reaper. Later disillusioned when reality
doesn't match.

Returns as antagonist in OVA/Season --- villain born not from void (like
Tomas) but from broken faith in compassion + survival.

# Other Notes & Concepts

Concordia's Idyllic Facade: beautiful harmony outside, dystopia beneath
--- disappearances, remediation.

Fred's Mask Motif: branding/marketing echo --- jovial mask cracking
underneath.

OVA Potential: explore Concordia's silenced officers (Bancroft, Quen).

Black Horizon --- v1.8 \[LOCKED\] Patch Inserts

# v1.7.4 --- Concordia Idyllic Facade (Revision)

• Reframed as genuinely happy, privileged 'rich neighborhood' culture
with many unspoken rules.

• Outsiders (Astra) find it sterile/suffocating; insiders see
harmony/privilege.

## Black Horizon --- v1.9 \[LOCKED\] Patch Inserts

• No new inserts for this version; content carried forward from v1.8.


## Black Horizon — v1.10 [LOCKED] Patch Inserts
### Concordia Daily Life
Rich-neighborhood perfection, parting phrase 'Through the Eminar.'

### Kale Seed
Child refugee myth-struck by Angel/Reaper; disillusionment → antagonist vector.

### Season Stinger/Theme
Horizon Aether stinger; Season 2 motif: endurance/renewal/scars.
