title: Nerina Vale Character Bible v1.7 \[Integrated\]
---

# Core Identity

Empath newtype pilot of Aetheris. Believes emotions are what tether
humanity.

Creed: \'The feelings of living beings are the only thing that makes war
tolerable.\'

Her tragedy: her creed is corroded until she dies in silence,
overwhelmed by ordinary soldiers.

# Public Face vs. Private Truth

Public: graceful, radiant, compassionate. Refugees see her as salvation.
Her very presence inspires songs and myths.

Private: burdened by empathy. She feels every death, every cry --- it
weighs her heavily, even as she hides the cracks.

# Beliefs & Contradictions

Sees emotions as war's only redeeming quality.

Contradiction: her sensitivity makes her a savior, but also leaves her
vulnerable --- the absence of feeling cuts her deeper than any blade.

Fatal flaw: she cannot reconcile the void Tomas embodies.

# Pilot Style

Aetheris: ballet-like, empathic grace. Drone wings move with foresight,
guided by her emotional resonance.

Black Horizon (necessity sortie): Moves with terrifying grace --- proves
Horizon's true potential. Steps away shaken: \'It feels scarred. Not
mine.\'

Later: brilliance intact, but hesitation grows as Tomas erodes her
faith. Eventually falters fatally.

# Key Turning Points

Ep. 8 --- Necessity Sortie: Briefly flies Horizon, shows its intended
perfection. Proves to Astra brass that Horizon deserves a wunderkind
pilot.

Ep. 11/12 --- Dashiel Erased: Feels nothing from him, nothing from
Tomas. Her creed cracks.

Act III --- Corrosion: Each clash with Tomas strips her further, as his
void denies her what she most needs.

Ep. 18 --- Collapse: Overwhelmed by Concordian soldiers. Should never
have happened, but her hesitation leaves her exposed. Dies not by
Tomas's blade, but because he scarred her too deeply.

Supernova Night: ops trap + phantom drag; music grammar (silence →
cacophony → \'Why not?\' → final silence).

# Visual POV Language

Often depicted radiant in Fred's grayscale POV --- her \'light\'
flickers more as her faith erodes.

By the end, Fred sees her collapse as that light extinguishing
completely.

# Arc Summary

Act I: Introduced as radiant pilot, bonds with Fred.

Act II: Pilots Horizon briefly, unsettled by its scars. Witnesses
Dashiel's death → cracks begin.

Act III: Spiral --- corrodes under Tomas's void, eventually overwhelmed.

Her Tragedy: Would have recovered in time. Tomas denied her that.

Black Horizon --- v1.8 \[LOCKED\] Patch Inserts

# v1.7.1 --- Empathy Structure & Sync Thresholds

• Emotional spectrum perceived as music.

• Harmony Sync thresholds:

\- ≥70: trust emotions fully; drones operate independently with
foresight.

\- 50--70: blend resonance + tactics.

\- \<50: disregard spectrum; Aetheris failsafe tool-modes only
(shield/beam).

# v1.7.1 --- Supernova Night (Last Stand)

• Notices sync dropping, refuses to abandon empathy; chooses sacrifice
to protect Astra.

• Final surge is not self-destruct; it's endurance beyond survival
parameters until attrition overwhelms her.

• Fred exchange: "Why are you doing this?" / "...Why not?"

# v1.7.2a --- Bar Visits (Post-Dashiel)

• Begins visiting Mara's Bar to re-ground among civilians.

• Usually moderate drinking; occasional overindulgence like any
non-alcoholic under strain.

## Black Horizon --- v1.9 \[LOCKED\] Patch Inserts

• No new inserts for this version; content carried forward from v1.8.


## Black Horizon — v1.10 [LOCKED] Patch Inserts
### Mask Piercing (v1.9.4)
Crossings on stairs → lingering conversations → almost connection.

### Spiral Refinement (v1.9.5)
Symphony → dissonance → fracture (Dashiel) → static (Tomas) → broken song → silence.

### Integration
Angel myth suffocates her as empathy fails, amplifying tragedy.


## Black Horizon — v1.10.1 [LOCKED] Patch Inserts

### Mask Piercing (Act I Anchor)
- First interaction with Fred (Ep. 2–3).
- Exchange:
  - Fred: [laughs] "Guess I can't always be funny."
  - Nerina: "I don't need to laugh right now… but you do."
- Function: Demonstrates her creed in practice — empathy naming what someone else feels. 
  Establishes her unique ability to pierce Fred's mask, setting tone for their bond and the later crossings motif.
