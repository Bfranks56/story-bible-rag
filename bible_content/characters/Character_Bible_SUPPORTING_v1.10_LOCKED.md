# Astra Command & Voices

Jan Doven --- Commander. Utilitarian leader of the LaSalle. Values
survival above glory; pragmatism drives his decisions. Represents
Astra's cautious attempts to manage Horizon and its pilots. His \'course
correction\' in assigning Dashiel to Horizon is a fatal misstep.

Karl Erdingher --- Chief Engineer. Gruff, detail-oriented, speaks in
mechanical shorthand. Deeply skeptical of myths; calls Horizon a
\'half-finished bastard.\' Provides technical grounding, often the first
to warn against misusing Horizon --- warnings that go unheeded.

Orlando Brech --- Political Functionary. Smooth, pragmatic, always aware
of morale and optics. Sees the myths of Reaper and Angel as tools for
cohesion. Presses for decisions that \'look\' right to the refugees,
even when strategically unwise.

Mara Holt --- Civilian Voice. Outspoken refugee advocate. Emotional
counterbalance to Astra command --- reminds them the fleet is not just
soldiers. Pressures leadership with the human cost of decisions; runs
Mara's Bar (jukebox-only, after-hours banter, Act IV epiphany seed).

# Concordia Brass

Serik Helvane --- Loyal General. Old-school soldier, unwavering loyalty
to Antoni. Believes in Concordia's harmony without question. Role:
Tomas's enforcer; never doubts the king.

Kael Bancroft --- Skeptical Officer. Analytical, clipped dialogue,
rarely speaks at length. Lines like: \'Remarkably astute, sire\' /
\'That exceeds convention.\' Fate: vanishes from the story without
comment. His absence itself is Concordia's efficiency at work. Chair
permanently empty.

Manon Quen --- Discreet Strategist. Reserved, sharp-eyed. Appears she
has more to say but chooses discretion. Designer of the Royal Synapse;
infers Sovereign is human but stays silent.

# Function in Narrative

Astra cast = flawed, reactive leadership. They mythologize Fred and
Nerina, then attempt a \'course correction\' (reassigning Horizon to
Dashiel), repeating Concordia's thinking without Tomas's clarity. Their
missteps make Concordia's precision sharper by contrast.

Concordia brass = mirror image. They execute Antoni's will with
near-perfect discipline, save for Bancroft's clipped skepticism. Their
silence and disappearances reinforce Tomas's philosophy of remediation
through absence.

Black Horizon --- v1.8 \[LOCKED\] Patch Inserts

# v1.7.2 --- Mara Holt & The Bar

• Proprietor of Fred's 3rd space; jukebox-only, kicks out live
music/singing (recurring gag).

• Sounding board for Fred; mild pity; allows after-hours company; not
equipped to fix him.

• Choir absent in the bar; street-level hub.

# v1.7.2a --- Interaction with Nerina

• Treats Nerina as any patron; keeps dignity; watches for rare nights
she's had too much without making a scene.

## Black Horizon --- v1.9 \[LOCKED\] Patch Inserts

### v1.8.4 --- Karl's Assistant Gag

• Pattern: Assistant proposes → Karl dismisses → later implemented.

• Act I: chevron exchange as series opener.

• Act II: thruster pivoting dismissed; later mimicked in combat.

• Act III: cockpit reinforcement dismissed; saves Fred.

• Act IV: shield fragment idea dismissed; Horizon Aether debuts with
ablative shield.

### Tone & Voice

• Karl's dismissals clipped, sardonic, mechanical shorthand.

• Never acknowledges implementation on-screen.

### v1.8.4 --- Karl's Assistant Gag (Addendum)

• Opening beat explicitly references chevrons (hazard chevrons exchange
as series first line).

• Tone includes gallows humor in Karl's clipped, mechanical shorthand;
he never acknowledges later implementation.


## Black Horizon — v1.10 [LOCKED] Patch Inserts
### Karl Erdingher
Expanded running gag: chevrons, thrusters, harness, shield plating.

### Mara Holt / Concordia
Mara’s Bar jukebox-only rule, Nerina visits post-Dashiel. Concordia norms integrated.

### Bancroft / Brass
Bancroft’s disappearance, brass using myths as morale levers.
