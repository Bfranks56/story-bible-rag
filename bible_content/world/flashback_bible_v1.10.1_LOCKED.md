title: Flashback Bible v1.7 \[Integrated\]
---

# Scope

Fred is the only character with flashbacks. His grief (wife and child
lost) defines him, so memory fragments belong only to him.

Other characters may talk about their pasts, but only Fred's are
visualized.

# Format & Style

Visual: always grayscale, even after POV color returns in Act IV.
Film-grain texture, muted light.

Sound: muffled, echoing, sometimes muted. Battlefield sounds sometimes
bleed in.

Editing: brief, fragmentary. Gestures, voices, fragments. Cut into
action, triggered by stress.

# Content of Flashbacks

Wife: glimpses of warmth --- laughter, quiet domestic moments. Almost
never words.

Child: playful innocence; tiny details (a hand, a toy, a laugh).

Loss: implied, never explicit. Absence speaks louder.

# Usage Rules

Deployed sparingly: 2--3 times per Act.

Always tied to Fred's present emotional state.

Act I: quick glimpses. Act II: escalate, tied to watching Dashiel/Nerina
shine. Act III: sharp invasive flashes. Act IV: merge with color return.

# Key Moments

Act I, Ep. 1--2: child's laughter muted under alarms as Fred stumbles
into Horizon.

Act II, Ep. 9--10: watching Dashiel, Fred recalls clumsy self vs child's
hand.

Act III, Ep. 18: Nerina collapses → Fred sees wife's hand slipping away.

Act IV, Ep. 21: Horizon Aether awakens → child's laughter heard clearly
for first time.

# Symbolic Purpose

Flashbacks = grief as shadow. Always grayscale until final color return.

By end: grief + compassion coexist. Memories gain sound + color = proof
of acceptance.
