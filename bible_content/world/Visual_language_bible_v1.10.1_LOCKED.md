# Fred (Protagonist)

POV Filter: Sees the world in grayscale. A direct metaphor for grief ---
everything is \'painted black.\'

Act IV (Horizon Aether): color returns. First gradually, then fully, as
he realizes his mask was for himself.

Cinematography: off-center, slightly awkward compositions. Movements
jerky, asymmetric, as if the camera itself fumbles with him.

Black Horizon in Fred's Hands: rough, unpredictable. Collides, stumbles,
overshoots --- yet survives and strikes.

# Nerina Vale (The Empath)

POV in Fred's Eyes: subtle glow or radiance against grayscale. Her
\'light\' flickers as her spiral progresses.

Cinematography: smooth, radiant frames. Ballet-like camera work when in
battle. By Act III, cracks appear: hesitant movements, flickering light.

Aetheris: graceful, empathic ballet. Drone wings swirl with foresight,
harmony.

Black Horizon (necessity sortie): terrifying perfection. Nerina
unsettled: \'scarred, heavy, not mine.\'

# Tomas Antoni / The Sovereign

Dual Language: Antoni (public) = warm tones, idyllic harmony. Sovereign
(private) = cold tones, stark contrasts, sharp edges.

Cinematography: Antoni scenes wide, balanced, pastoral. Sovereign =
tight, still, silence-heavy.

Regalia: subtle, surgical. Funnels orbit like a crown, moving with
unnerving synchronicity.

# Dashiel Mercer

Visual: clean, heroic framing. Bright, balanced color. Classic Gundam
hero shots.

In Fred's grayscale POV: untouched by shadow --- glowing in contrast.

Death: framing collapses suddenly --- iconic shot torn apart by
unceremonious erasure.

# Mecha Visual Language

Black Horizon (Reaper): chaotic animation. Panels fold unpredictably,
armor clicks like a butterfly knife. In Fred's hands = jittery, erratic.
In Nerina's sortie = smooth, graceful, terrifying.

Aetheris (Angel of Astra): white + teal glow, ballet-like combat.
Radiant contrast against void.

Valiant Gundam: archetypal design. Reliable, inspiring --- until erased
without ceremony.

Regalia (Silent King): purple + gold, symmetry. Funnels orbit
crown-like. Slow pans emphasize inevitability.

Horizon Aether (Dawn Reaper): white armor w/ teal glow + black scars.
Combines Fred's chaos + Nerina's grace. Mistakes reframed as feints.

# Mythic & Civilian Imagery

Refugee Choir: songs depicted as overlapping audio + visual overlays.
Myths dramatized in real-time.

Black Reaper: silhouetted chaos. Angel: radiant saint. Silent King:
unseen, erased. Dawn Reaper: white flame scarred black, civilians gasp.

# Flashback Integration (Fred Only)

Always grayscale, grainy, muffled sound. Memories of wife/child intercut
with battle.

Never overused --- sparing but heavy. Final stage: Act IV, when color +
sound re-enter.

Black Horizon --- v1.8 \[LOCKED\] Patch Inserts

# v1.7.1 --- Supernova Night Imagery

• HUD overlays shift from clear tones (≥70) → distorted chords (50--70)
→ dissonant static (\<50).

• At \<50, drones lock into rigid shield/beam formations; grace gives
way to mechanical output.

• Fred's grayscale POV: Nerina's radiance flickers → extinguishes on
"Why not?".

# v1.7.2 --- Bar Atmosphere

• Dim, crowded, jukebox hum constant; public = Fred performing;
after-hours = quiet clatter, Mara + Fred 1:1.

## Black Horizon --- v1.9 \[LOCKED\] Patch Inserts

### v1.8.1 --- POV Color Return (Visual Mapping)

• Ep. 10: total grayscale.

• Ep. 21: Horizon Aether in full color; world flickers like synapse
recalibration.

• Ep. 22--23: compassion = color; fear = collapse.

• Ep. 24: Regalia always full color; Fred stabilizes.

• Ep. 25: full stable color with scars; whites tinged gray; epilogue
grayscale fades.

### v1.8.2 --- Valiant Integration Visuals

• Beam saber: violet blade.

• Shield: black ablative plating, butterfly-knife reformation, chips
fly/reform, never pristine.

### v1.8.4 --- Opening Staging

• Assistant: \'Ditch the hazard chevrons. They scream prototype.\'

• Karl: \'Yeah, and then some grease-monkey walks into a live conduit.
Great idea. No.\'

• Payoff: soot/fire strip markings, Horizon emerges pure black
silhouette, Choir erupts.
